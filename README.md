# Tic-tac-toe

## Create a functioning game of tic-tac-toe without frameworks.

The goal of this project is to create tic-tac-toe without using any frameworks (like React, NodeJS, etc). This was created purely
in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It uses some basic formatting and colors to make things look nice.

The assignment is a part of [TheOdinProject's](https://theodinproject.com/) web development tutorials.

## TODO

1. Indicate which player's turn it is.
2. Keep score of wins and losses for each player.
3. Allow the option to play again instead of having to resubmit names after each game.
